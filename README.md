# federicoschermi.dev
This is the GitHub repository for my personal website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Some stuff
For the design and style of the website, I used the following libraries:
- [animate](https://animate.style/) for animations;
- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as an alternative to CSS resets;
- [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) as a boilerplate for small projects like mine.

For authentication handling, login window (which will be removed), countdown, and theme toggle, I used JavaScript.

I chose to use the [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)font, which I believe is an excellent choice for readability.
